# ACCESS training material

This page is intended to provide access to training material directly related to ACCESS models and model components. This material can cover topics such as but not limited to:

 - how to use a specific model
 - how to modify a model configuration
 - how to test a model modification or validate a model run

## [JULES tutorials][jules-tutorials] {{ recommended }}

The JULES tutorials explain how to use FCM, Rose and Cylc both for using the model and for development work. They can be useful to ACCESS users as practical demonstrations of the Rose and Cylc infrastructure.

## Unified Model {{ recommended }}

### Documentation
Documentation of the different version of the Unified Model (UM), including UM User Guides, can be found on the [Met Office Science Repository Service (MOSRS)](https://code.metoffice.gov.uk/). Access to this information requires you to have an account on the Met Office server. Email <cws_help@nci.org.au> to request an account. 

### Tutorials

Over the past few years, a number of UM modelling workshops and tutorials have been held by the MetOffice and the Bureau of Meteorology. For example, the Met Office ran a recent [UM Users Tutorial](https://code.metoffice.gov.uk/trac/jumps/wiki/UMTutorial2019) that gave an overview of the different components of the UM and tools used alongside it. Refer to [Workshops and Conferences](https://access-hive.org.au/events/) on the ACCESS-Hive for any upcoming training events involving the UM model.


## ACCESS Climate Model Training {{ recommended }}
Here you can find some useful [training resources](https://confluence.csiro.au/display/ACCESS/ACCESS+Training) for [getting started](http://climate-cms.wikis.unsw.edu.au/ACCESS) with ACCESS-CM2 & ACCESS-ESM1.5 climate models.
