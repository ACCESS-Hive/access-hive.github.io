{{ community }} [Australian Community Reference Climate Data Collection @ NCI](https://aus-ref-clim-data-nci.github.io/aus-ref-clim-data-nci/intro.html)

This colllection is a collaborative effort between the Australian Climate Service (ACS), ARC Centre of Excellence for Climate Extremes (CLEX) and the wider Australian climate research community to re-establish and maintain a reference dataset collection at NCI.

An [intake-esm catalogue](https://github.com/aus-ref-clim-data-nci/acs-replica-intake) is also available to facilitate data access.
