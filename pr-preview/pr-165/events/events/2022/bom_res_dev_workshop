description: Water is at the core of the Earth system interactions, however, closing the water balance in a coupled Earth System Model remains a grand challenge. The workshop brings together experts from across these fields to discuss the latest scientific innovations and how we can work together to provide the Australian and international community with improved services and decision-making capabilities, resulting in greater impact and value. The workshop is open to all, and attendees are invited to contribute.
