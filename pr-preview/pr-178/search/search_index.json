Open an issue For all additions or modifications to the ACCESS-Hive site, it is recommended to start by opening an Issue in the ACCESS-Hive GitHub repository. Consider assigning the Issue to yourself in the right-hand side panel if you intend on working on the issue and you are a member of ACCESS-Hive organisation. Installation ACCESS-Hive repository You first should clone the ACCESS-Hive repository to your local machine: git clone git@github.com:ACCESS-Hive/website.git Markdown This documentation is based on the Material for Mkdocs theme. Please see the documentation for the theme or for Mkdocs for a full explanation of all the capabilities. The documentation is written in Markdown format. Please see this cheat sheet for a quick reference to the base syntax. Please note that Material for Mkdocs extends that syntax. Software installation To build the site locally, you need to install Material for Mkdocs and other plugins. You can find a full list in the requirements.txt file in the root of the ACCESS-Hive repository. Please use pip for the installation as some of the conda packages are not kept up-to-date: pip install -r requirements.txt Edit to ACCESS-Hive Once you have installed all you need, you will need to follow the usual series of steps when contributing to Open Source developments: open an Issue clone the repository locally start a branch to work on, linked to the Issue commit your modifications to that branch and push to GitHub open a pull request between the main branch and your branch, follow the instructions from the Pull request template. ask for reviews by tagging the ACCESS-Hive/reviewers team and reply to requests for changes If you don't know how to do these steps, please refer to our Git and GitHub training . What page to edit If you have problems finding the page you need to edit, the easiest way is to head to the ACCESS-Hive site. If you click on the pen icon at the top right of each page title, you will open a GitHub page showing you the path to the file you want to edit. Headers and table of content The level 1 headers are reserved for the title of the page and are ignored from the pages' table of contents. Only use level 2 headers and higher to organise pages. Preview of the documentation Preview from a Pull Request When a pull request is created or updated, GitHub will automatically build a preview of the documentation that includes the proposed changes. In the pull request, you will see the link to the preview appear in this fashion: Build delay It can take a while for the preview to build, even after the CI check is indicated as finished. Please wait for the comment with the link to appear and allow for some time after that for the preview to be properly deployed. If you open the preview and it looks completely broken or if it hasn't updated from additional modifications in the pull request, it probably means the site hasn't finished building yet. If you wait a little bit and refresh the page, it should fix itself. Local preview (if editing on your own computer) Requires software installation You can only preview your local changes if you have installed mkdocs-material on your computer. MkDocs includes a live preview server, so you can preview your changes as you write your documentation. The server will automatically rebuild the site upon saving.

There is an index.md file for the About page, one folder per tab on the site, an assets/ folder to store images used in the documentation and some customisation folders such as css/ or font/ . mkdocs.yml : it is a YAML formatted file, hence the .yml extension. The site navigation is defined in this file as well as options for the styling of the site. YAML YAML is a popular choice for configuration files, as it is a simple way of encoding data structures in a text file. See this short tutorial . A simple example The easiest way to explain how the navigation is defined is to look at an example. Let's say mkdocs.yml contains: nav : - Welcome : index.md - ACCESS-NRI : ACCESS-NRI/ACCESS-NRI.md - Community : - Generate Bathymetry : community/bathymetry.md - How to contribute : - How to contribute : help/how_to_contribute.md - Setup : help/contribution_setup.md - Modify the documentation : help/modify_documentation.md - Change the navigation : help/change_navigation.md The top level category names define the tabs in the header bar. So here we have the tabs: \"Welcome\", \"ACCESS-NRI\", \"Community\" and \"How to contribute\". It also defines the name of the top section under each tab. The second level of categories indicate the name of each page under that section. So the \"ACCESS-NRI\" tab has the text directly under the section \"ACCESS-NRI\". The \"Community\" tab has a section called \"Community\" that contains one page: \"Generate Bathymetry\". Finally, the \"How to contribute\" tab has 1 section \"How to contribute\" with 4 pages. The filenames indicate the path to the file relative to the docs/ folder containing the text for each page. It is recommended to use the title of each file (i.e. the Header 1) as the name of the page and the filename. Add sections to a tab It is possible to define several sections per tab by using more levels of indentation. For example, to add a \"My example\" section to the \"How to contribute\" tab: nav : - Welcome : index.md - ACCESS-NRI : ACCESS-NRI/ACCESS-NRI.md - Community : - Generate Bathymetry : community/bathymetry.md - How to contribute : - How to contribute : help/how_to_contribute.md - Setup : help/contribution_setup.md - Modify the documentation : help/modify_documentation.md - Change the navigation : help/change_navigation.md - My example : - Beautiful example : help/beautiful_example.md will create this navigation:","title":"Change the navigation"},{"location":"about/contribute/navigation_changes/#change-the-navigation","text":"","title":"Change the navigation"},{"location":"about/contribute/navigation_changes/#structure-of-the-repository","text":"The important elements of the repository to know about before modifying the navigation are: docs/ folder: this folder contains all the documentation pages.

Please ask one of the maintainers to invite you to join the organisation. Reviewer Guidelines Firstly, thank you so much for helping to review links submitted to the ACCESS-Hive, we\u2019re delighted to have your help. This document is designed to outline our editorial guidelines and help you understand our requirements for accepting a pull request (PR). Guiding principles If the submitting authors have followed the contribution guidelines then the review should be rapid. For those PRs that don\u2019t quite meet the requirements, please try to give clear feedback on what needs fixing. Our goal is to maintain a high quality platform for exchanging links to relevant documentation and you, as a reviewer, have a key role to play. A review involves checking submissions against a checklist of essential features and details described at the top of each PR.

ACCESS-CM2 Citation 1 | Tutorial ACCESS-CM2 1 is one of Australia\u2019s contributions to the World Climate Research Programme\u2019s Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6). The component models are: UM10.6 GA7.1 for the atmosphere, CABLE2.5 for the land surface, MOM5 for the ocean, and CICE5.1.2 for the sea ice. Compared to previous model versions ACCESS-CM2 shows better global hydrological balance, more realistic ocean water properties (in terms of spatial distribution) and meridional overturning circulation in the Southern Ocean but a poorer simulation of the Antarctic sea ice and a larger energy imbalance at the top of atmosphere. This energy imbalance reflects a noticeable warming trend of the global ocean over the spin-up period.

IOMB uses the same code base as the International Land Model Benchmarking (ILAMB) Package, so some of the links above refer to ILAMB instead of IOMB.","title":"The International Ocean Model Benchmarking (IOMB)  "},{"location":"model_evaluation/data_catalogs/","text":"Data Communities / Catalogs We need you to contribute!
