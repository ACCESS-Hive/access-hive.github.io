The focus is on the ACCESS-OM2 suite of models being developed and run by members of COSIMA: Consortium for Ocean-Sea Ice Modelling in Australia. The framework is suited to analysing any MOM5/MOM6 output, as well as output from other models. The cookbook is structured as follows: The cosima-cookbook repository includes boiler-plate code and scripts that underpin the cookbook, including a database for exploring and loading available data. The cosima-recipes repository includes example notebooks on which you can base your analyses. METPLUS Domain : Atmosphere Tutorial METplus is a verification framework that spans a wide range of temporal (warn-on-forecast to climate) and spatial (storm to global) scales. It is intended to be extensible through additional capability developed by the community. The core components of the framework include MET, the associated database and display systems called METviewer and METexpress, and a suite of Python wrappers to provide low-level automation and examples, also called use-cases. METplus will be a component of NOAA's Unified Forecast System (UFS) cross-cutting infrastructure as well as NCAR's System for Integrated Modeling of the Atmosphere (SIMA). METplus is being actively developed by NCAR/Research Applications Laboratory (RAL), NOAA/Earth Systems Research Laboratories (ESRL), NOAA/Environmental Modeling Center (EMC), and is open to community contributions.

There is an index.md file for the Welcome page, one folder per tab on the site and an assets/ folder to store images used in the documentation. mkdocs-community.yml : it is a YAML formatted file, hence the .yml extension. The site navigation is defined in this file as well as options for the styling of the site. Info YAML is a popular choice for configuration files, as it is a simple way of encoding data structures in a text file. See this short tutorial . A simple example The easiest way to explain how the navigation is defined is to look at an example. Let's say mkdocs.yml contains: nav : - Welcome : index.md - ACCESS-NRI : ACCESS-NRI/ACCESS-NRI.md - Community : - Generate Bathymetry : community/bathymetry.md - How to contribute : - How to contribute : help/how_to_contribute.md - Setup : help/contribution_setup.md - Modify the documentation : help/modify_documentation.md - Change the navigation : help/change_navigation.md The top level category names define the tabs in the header bar.

This method is adequate for small modifications to a single file. local edit on your local computer. This method is recommended for large modifications. Open an issue For all additions or modifications to the ACCESS-Hub site, it is recommended to start by opening an Issue in the ACCESS-Hub GitHub repository. After creation, please assign the Issue to yourself in the right-hand side panel if you intend on working on the issue. Edit directly on GitHub For a very simple change, the easiest is to go to the page you want to modify on the ACCESS-Hub documentation site. At the right of the title, you will see a pen icon . Pen icon circled in red When you click on this icon, your browser will open the file in GitHub allowing you to edit the file. Enter your modification in the main pane. Then add a commit message in the Commit changes box. Where to write your commit message Important You then need to choose to create a new branch and start a pull request. The main branch of the repository is protected and nobody can write to it directly. When creating the pull request, make sure to add the text: Closes #X to the description, where X is the issue number related to this change. This will link the pull request and the issue together and the issue will be automatically closed once the pull request is accepted. This will also automatically build a preview of the documentation with your proposed changes . Then ask for a review using the Reviewer menu on the right-hand side panel. You will be notified by email of any subsequent comment, request or action from the reviewer on this pull request. Please make sure you take any action required by the reviewer or your modification will not be accepted into the ACCESS-Hub site. Note The level 1 headers are reserved for the title of the page and are ignored from the pages' table of contents. Only use level 2 headers and higher to organise pages. Edit locally on your computer If you prefer to work locally on your computer (e.g. to preview the result of your modification locally before submitting it to the documentation), you will need to follow the usual series of steps when contributing to Open Source developments: open an Issue clone the repository locally start a branch to work on linked to the Issue commit your modifications to that branch and push to GitHub open a pull request between the main branch and your branch ask for reviews and reply to requests for changes If you don't know how to do these steps, please refer to our Git and GitHub training . Tip If you have problems finding the page you need to edit, the easiest way is to head to the ACCESS-Hub site.
